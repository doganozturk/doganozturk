Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm DoÄŸan, a software engineer based in Istanbul, Turkey.

As a chemical-engineer turned software guy, I was enamoured at an early age with the Internet and World Wide Web. Even though my professional experience started much later, my curiosity of the field, tools and patterns are on fire!

Nowadays I am mainly focused on all things JavaScript, Node.js and a little bit from other platforms/languages, too. Currently I work at [Trendyol](https://github.com/trendyol), Turkey's leading e-commerce platform and a part of Alibaba Group. I develop cross-platform mobile applications in React-Native, backends in Node.js and client facing web applications with React in my day to day job.

My work on GitHub is mostly self-learning material. I hope there is something that is useful to you there, too.
