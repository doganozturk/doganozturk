Hello, I'm DoÄŸan, a software engineer based in Istanbul, Turkey.

My professional journey is a diverse one, starting with a degree in chemical engineering and a few years in the field. However, my fascination with coding, which has deep roots, eventually became my primary focus. Through dedication, passion, and a touch of luck, I transitioned into the realm of professional software development.

Throughout my career, I've worked with a range of languages, primarily focusing on JavaScript, both on front-end and Node.js. I've had the opportunity to employ various front-end frameworks, including Svelte, Qwik, Vue, with a particular emphasis on React and React-Native on mobile. On the back-end, I've utilized micro-frameworks like Express.js and Koa, as well as more comprehensive solutions such as Nest.js. Beyond these, I've dabbled in Go, Python, and Java. My core expertise lies in front-end and Backends for Frontends (BFF) development, where I favor TypeScript. Additionally, I maintain a platform-oriented perspective as necessary.

Currently, I'm part of the Trendyol team, Turkey's leading e-commerce platform. My role involves developing cross-platform mobile applications, backend solutions, and web applications for clients.

I have a keen interest in alternative JavaScript runtimes like Deno and Bun. My goal is to deepen my understanding of back-end development to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the full life-cycle of web and mobile applications.

As a self-motivated learner with a product mindset, I thrive in environments where I can take full ownership of my tasks. I appreciate minimal management and the efficiency of small, responsible teams making frequent, incremental developments.

I firmly believe in the principles of CI/CD and prefer trunk-based development when possible. To me, automated testing is an indispensable part of the development process. I also have experience in monitoring production applications using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, the ELK stack, and NewRelic.

On my GitHub profile, you'll find a collection of self-learning materials and projects. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss tech.
