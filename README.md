Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm DoÄŸan, a software engineer based in Istanbul, Turkey.

As a chemical engineer turned software guy, I was enamored early with the Internet and World Wide Web. Even though my professional experience started much later, my curiosity about the field, tools, and patterns is on fire!

I mainly focus on all things JavaScript, Node.js, and other JS runtimes such as Deno. 

Currently, I work at Trendyol, Turkey's leading e-commerce platform and a part of Alibaba Group. In my day-to-day job, I develop cross-platform mobile applications in React-Native, backends in Node.js, and client-facing web applications with React.

My work on GitHub is mostly self-learning material. I hope there is something valuable to you there, too.
