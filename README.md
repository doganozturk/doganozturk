I'm DoÄŸan, an experienced software engineer located in Istanbul, Turkey. My expertise lies in front-end and Backend for Frontend (BFF) development. I currently serve on a leading e-commerce team in Turkey, focusing on cross-platform mobile and web applications.

In addition to my core responsibilities, I maintain a broad interest in emerging technologies, continually seeking to expand my technical scope. As a self-motivated learner with a product mindset, I thrive in environments that allow for full ownership of tasks and appreciate minimal management. I excel in small, responsible teams that prioritize frequent, incremental developments.

I am a strong advocate for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), with a focus on automated testing and efficient application monitoring.

Feel free to explore my profile for more insights, and don't hesitate to reach out for any tech-related discussions or queries.
